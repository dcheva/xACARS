# xACARS - C# Rewrite
I originally wrote xACARS in python a while ago, but since then ive wanted to rewrite it in C#. That way, the following can be done:
- x64 version of xACARS to be done (not 100% sure if the FSUIPC SDK for C# supports 64-bit applications, but it looks like it does)
- Easier to package (Currently the python files have to be made into an executable)

This might take a while, and will likely be done with WinForms. This will feature a UI close to that of the redesign done by Henry Shires of [Estafeta Virtual](https://www.estafetava.com/) for the Python version.
